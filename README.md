# Soil Classification-EOAS-with Python

Python script to utilize given CPT data for preliminary liquifiction analysis and output the data in excel file and a plotting them using matplotlib.

## Things you will need

* Powershell(Windows), Ubuntu Terminal(Windows Subsystem Linux version) or Terminal(macOS)
* An IDE: 
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
* Package Managers:
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) - [Install Python3 using pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html)
- [python3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - CHECK your current python version by ```python --version```



### Tips and Tools

* General Syntax
- You don’t have to know much other than some basic stuff
- It’s always a good idea to look into documentation if you use something from a library
- Try thinking everything in your PLAIN language first, then translate it to what you need to do.
* Functions
- Always a good idea to break down your code into sections called “functions”. Very similar to how Math functions work. 
- Don’t put too many things in your main function. 
* Bugs and Workarounds 
- Opensource problems. At any rate, in a workplace, you will be expected to find a solution or a workaround to any bugs that you face that doesn’t have an “official” bug fix.


## Resources

* Syntax and sample exercises to get you familiar with Python:
1. https://developers.google.com/edu/python
2. https://www.coursera.org/learn/python
* Setting up Python environment (Python 3+)
May have to spend some time correctly setting it up. A lot of systems still use Python2.7

2. https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
3. HomeBrew https://brew.sh/
4. Pip3 https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
5. And of course, YouTube!
* You may be required to download additional things like Python Linter and other extensions based on the IDE you use. Autocompletion is helpful
1. https://kite.com/ <- Helps with autocomplete snippets
2. PyCodeStyle is a good linter. It can be annoying sometimes, but is helpful with neatness!
3. https://github.com/psf/black <- makes your script look pretty, very aggressive though!
* If you come across weird errors, just google them! Chances are people faced the same kind of problems. StackOverflow  and google is your best friend.

2. https://pypi.org/project/numpy/
3. https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/ 
* A little bit of shell commands like ls, sudo(careful!!!), cd
